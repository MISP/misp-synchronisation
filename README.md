# MISP Synchronisation

![MISP Synchronisation](https://github.com/MISP/misp-synchronisation/blob/main/docs/logo.png)

**MISP Synchronisation** is a project aimed at facilitating the local deployment of multiple instances of [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) and the configuration of their synchronisation connections.
It relies on the [MISP Docker](https://github.com/MISP/misp-docker) repository to easily deploy the different instances in containers.

In addition, this project includes a set of synchronisation tests based on the [PyMISP](https://github.com/MISP/PyMISP/) library to verify that data sharing between instances is working properly.
